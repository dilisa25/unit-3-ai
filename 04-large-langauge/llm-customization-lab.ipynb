    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** A Large Language Model is a type of AI Model that can understand and generate human language. It's different from traditional software because LLMs are expected to learn from the data they give by analyzing it and recognizing patterns; however traditional software has specific tasks and only does exactly what it's programmed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** To to \"prompt\" an LLM means to give spefcic instructions on what you want the large langauge model to generate. Prompting is so important to insure accurate results.\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** To create better prompts, you can assign roles to the LLM. Like if you help with work, tell it to talk to you like a tutor. If you need help with a business idea, consider consulting with us to take on the role of a Founder or CEO. Be as specific as possible when prompting engineering. Specify the desired tone length level in detail; is it talking to someone with a PhD or a 1st grader? \n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior are bias and fairness. The world is inherently biased and AI may inherit some of that bias and cause harm to users."
